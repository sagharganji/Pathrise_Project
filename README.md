## Data Challenge Assignment

Pathrise is an online program that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and advice to
help job seekers get the best possible jobs in tech. Every two weeks, Pathrise
welcomes a new cohort of fellows. If a candidate is interested in joining our program
and successfully passes all stages of our admission process, they receive an offer to
join Pathrise and become a fellow. The first 2 weeks in the program are called a free
trial period and a fellow can withdraw within this free trial period without any penalty.
After 2 weeks, a fellow needs to sign an ISA (Income Share Agreement) with us if they
want to stay in the program. The entire program lasts up to a year, including 8 weeks of
the core curriculum. If a fellow is unable to find a job within a year of joining Pathrise,
his/her contract is terminated. However, there might be some exceptions. For instance,
if someone is on a break, we may extend their contract for the period of the break.
On average, for fellows who stay with us after their free trial period, it takes about 4
months to receive a final job offer. However, there is a lot of variation in fellows’
outcomes. Being able to predict how fast every single fellow is going to find a job is
crucial for our business. In this exercise, we provide you with a sample of information we
collected from our fellows from the moment they joined our program. Please don’t
expect this data set to be perfect, it never happens in the real world.


**The main goal of my analysis is to derive insights into whether a fellow will
ultimately be placed at a company and how long until a placement can be
expected.**
